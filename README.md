================================
This is a lane defense game where you try to prevent Bowser from reaching the other side of your screen.
You use 3 blockades (brick, concrete, and electric), 
some are stronger but do less damage, and others are powerful, yet weak.
You gain money for dealing damage to bowser.  You use this money to buy blockades to stop Bowser.
When Bowser is dead he respawns with 1000 more health than the previous version.  He remains the same strength.
Once you kill five Bowsers, you win the game.

Please note: this game is best played on a 1920x1080 phone sized display.  The toolbar has display issues for strange 
reasons that could not be worked out.  

GOOD LUCK!
